            <p>Welcome to Web Tic Tac Toe! By using our game, you agree to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You play at your own risk, especially when facing off against the Tic Tac Toe Master (a.k.a. the computer).</li>
                <li>All your victories and defeats are stored in our database—forever. Choose your moves wisely!</li>
                <li>No cheating! We’ve got our eyes on you, and any funny business will result in an immediate timeout.</li>
                <li>Our Tic Tac Toe game is for fun, and we aim to keep it that way. Please be kind and respectful to other players.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember, it's all about having fun, sharpening your strategy skills, and maybe earning a few bragging rights along the way.</p>
            <p>Let’s keep it friendly, fair, and full of fun!</p>
