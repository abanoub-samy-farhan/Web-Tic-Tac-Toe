            <p>Your privacy is important to us. We promise to keep all your X’s and O’s safe and sound, and we’ll never sell your moves to the highest bidder.</p>
            <p>Here’s the scoop:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We collect some basic info, like your username, so we can save your game history and victories.</li>
                <li>Your data is stored securely, and only you have the power to access it.</li>
                <li>We use cookies (not the delicious kind, unfortunately) to keep your experience smooth and sweet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you ever feel like your privacy is at risk, just send us a message, and we’ll sort it out faster than you can say “Tic Tac Toe!”</p>
